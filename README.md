# item-greenwashing-detection
Capstone project for MS - AIML 
The scope of this study focuses on item-level sustainability verification within retail product listings, particularly in consumer goods categories where environmental claims are common, such as household cleaners, personal care products, and garden supplies. Corporate sustainability reporting and lifecycle assessments are outside the scope of this research.
The objectives of this capstone project are to design, implement, and evaluate a multimodal AI system capable of detecting discrepancies between sustainability marketing claims and verified regulatory chemical safety data.
